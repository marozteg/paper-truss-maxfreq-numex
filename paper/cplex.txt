1

(Simplex or Barrier) Optimal solution is available.
2	(Simplex or Barrier) Problem has an unbounded ray; see the concept Unboundedness for more information about infeasibility and unboundedness as a solution status.
3	
Simplex or Barrier) Problem has been proven infeasible; see the topic Interpreting Solution Quality in the IBM ILOG CPLEX User's Manual for more details.

4	(Simplex or Barrier) Problem has been proven either infeasible or unbounded; see the topic Effect of Preprocessing on Feasibility in the IBM ILOG CPLEX User's Manual for more details.
5	(Simplex or Barrier) Optimal solution is available, but with infeasibilities after unscaling.
6	(Simplex or Barrier) Solution is available, but not proved optimal, due to numeric difficulties during optimization.
10	Stopped due to limit on number of iterations. (Simplex or Barrier)
